One of the ethical issues that I identified is whether engineers who were aware of the MCAS system and knew the potential risk of using that system should speak up against these suspicious things. The intrigue behind this is that the answer for this question is positive out of intuition.  However, in the context of career, industry, and professional engineering setting, many factors may result in the pivot of the decision-making procedures.  It carries a specific meaning for the Boeing 737 Max case, as it has the potential to impact the trend that tragedy results from. Although the scope of this question may be not as big as other questions involving stakeholders such as Boeing, FAA, it is very important in the possibility that the fetal MCAS system can be avoided to be installed to the Boeing 737. 

In the process of deeper discussion of this ethical issue, we should take some consideration of the determining relevant facts and to evaluate the system and procedures relying on objective evidence.  There is information about MCAS operation from human resources: MCAS triggered 24 times during the flight as investigated; MCAS system was designed by Boeing to operate to change the orientation of the plane only relying on one sensor. This information conveys the weight of MCAS resulting in the fetal aircraft accident.  Plus, Boeing also includes limited information about MCAS in the initial briefing which turns out not to be an emphasis of certificate effort, which made the decision from engineers weighted more as less parties were aware of the existence of MCAS system and its operation mechanism. 

To resolve such issues, we conducted an ethical analysis. In this particular issue, there are different levels of stakeholder affected: primary would be Boeing airline engineers, passengers; secondary would be Boeing and FAA regulation; the decision makers would be designers and engineers. Conflicts here would be because of the ambiguity and non-disclosure of more details about MCAS, this may be hard to blame completely on one party, Boeing or designers and engineers. 

In order to formulate recommendations on resolving such a problem, we referred to ASME code of ethics of engineers rule No.1, which is that engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public in the performance of their professional duties. The assumption made here is that Boeing engineers have sufficient knowledge to identify the potential of MCAS. The justification here would be that since MCAS system design contains lack of rigorous iteration and well-rounded rely on multiple experimental measurement data, it is very reasonable to propose the questioning of MCAS design. 


The solution is that engineers should propose questions regarding suspiciousness. We did be aware of many constraints from different aspects: one apparent one would be organization pressure and job maintenance as employees are under pressure if they need to act in the opposite direction as company and managers.
