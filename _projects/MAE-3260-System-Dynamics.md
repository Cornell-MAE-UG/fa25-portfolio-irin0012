For the final porject in MAE 3260 System Dynamics, our team of three person conducted a mechanical dissection and dynamic analysis of a commerical massage gun. Through physical inspection and experimental testing, we examined how the internal motor and transmission generate vibrational motion and how the system responds to changes in input commands.
