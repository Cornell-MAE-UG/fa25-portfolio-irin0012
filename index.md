## About Me

Welcome to my Engineering Portfolio! I am Zhiyu (Iris) Ren, a mechanical engineer at Cornell University. My passion about sustainability and problem solving brought me to the field of engineering. These projects that I have worked on deepened my understanding of complex engineering systems and challenges associated with renewable energy developments. Through hands-on design and lab experience, modeling, and field deployment, I aim to develop practical solutions that balance engineering performance, sustainability and real-world constraints.
